He has become his family's sole source of income after the passing of his father. Everything changes when his family is attacked and slaughtered by a demon. Tanjirō and his sister Nezuko are the sole survivors of the incident, with Nezuko being transformed into a demon, but still surprisingly showing signs of human emotion and thought. After an encounter with Giyu Tomioka, a demon slayer, Tanjirō is recruited by Giyu to also become a demon slayer to help his sister turn human again and avenge the deaths of the rest of his family.",
